# React Native – (Fundamentals):
  * React Native setup
  * Project structure
  * Running app
  * Components: View, Text, Image, ScrollView, TextInput, Button
  * Styling: Flexbox, StyleSheet, Inline style
  * Platform-specific code 
  * StatusBar customization

## Overview
Today was **Day 1** of learning **React Native fundamentals**.  
On this day, I learned how to set up React Native, understand the project structure, run the app on Android & iOS, use basic components, apply styling, handle platform-specific code, and customize the StatusBar

This README explains **what I learned**, **why it is used**, and **how it works** in a simple way.

## 1. React Native Setup

I use **Expo CLI** to set up a React Native project:

### Why Expo CLI?
- Beginner friendly
- Fast setup
- No need to install Android Studio or Xcode initially
- Good for learning and small to medium apps

**Command:**
```bash
npx create-expo-app `FolderName`
cd `FolderNAme`
npx expo start
```

## 2. Project structure

* project-root/
* │── app/
* │── assets/
* │── components/
* │── constants/
* │── hooks/
* │── scripts/
* │── node_modules/
* │── app.json
* │── package.json
* │── tsconfig.json
* │── .gitignore


###  app/
The **core of the application**.  
This folder uses **Expo Router’s file-based routing system**, meaning:
- Each file automatically becomes a screen or route
- Folder names represent navigation paths

Example:
app/index.tsx → Home Screen
app/profile.tsx → Profile Screen


###  assets/
Centralized storage for **static resources**, including:
- Images
- Custom fonts
- Brand icons

Keeping assets here helps maintain a clean and organized project.


###  components/
Contains **reusable UI components** such as:
- Custom Buttons
- Input fields
- Cards
- Headers

This follows the **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principle and improves code reusability.


###  constants/
Stores **global constants** used across the app:
- Theme colors
- API endpoints
- Layout spacing
- Font sizes

This ensures consistency and makes updates easier.


###  hooks/
Houses **custom React hooks** that manage logic outside UI components.

Examples:
- `useAuth` → Authentication logic
- `useTheme` → Theme management

This improves code readability and separation of concerns.


###  scripts/
Includes **automation and utility scripts** used for:
- Project maintenance
- Deployment tasks
- Build-related operations


###  node_modules/
Stores all **third-party libraries and dependencies** installed via npm or yarn.  
 This folder is auto-generated and should not be modified manually.


##  Configuration Files

###  app.json
Expo configuration file that defines:
- App name
- App version
- Splash screen
- App icon
- Platform-specific settings


###  package.json
Tracks:
- Installed dependencies
- Development dependencies
- Project scripts (start, build, etc.)


###  tsconfig.json
Configures **TypeScript compiler options** to:
- Improve code quality
- Ensure type safety
- Reduce runtime errors


###  .gitignore
Specifies files and folders that Git should ignore, such as:
- `node_modules/`
- Build files
- Environment files

This keeps the repository clean and lightweight.
